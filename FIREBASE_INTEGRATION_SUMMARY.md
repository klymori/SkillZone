### Security Rules

The Firestore security rules ensure:
- Users can only read/write their own data
- Reviews can only be created/modified by authenticated users
- Likes can only be created/deleted by the user who liked
- Courses can only be modified by admin users
- All operations require proper authentication

## Testing

The integration has been tested for:
- User registration and login
- Profile updates and avatar uploads
- Course listing and detail views
- Review submission and like functionality
- Progress tracking
- Session persistence across reloads
- Error handling and user feedback

## Next Steps

1. Implement Firebase Functions for server-side logic
2. Add Firebase Hosting for production deployment
3. Implement Firebase Analytics for user behavior tracking
4. Add Firebase Cloud Messaging for notifications
5. Implement quiz functionality with Firestore storage
6. Add admin features for course management
7. Implement data backup and recovery procedures

## Known Issues

1. Some UI components may need additional dark theme adjustments
2. Error handling could be enhanced with more user-friendly messages
3. Performance optimization for large datasets may be needed
4. Offline support is not yet implemented

## Conclusion

The Firebase integration provides a solid foundation for a scalable, secure learning platform with real-time data synchronization and persistent user sessions. The implementation follows Firebase best practices and includes comprehensive security measures to protect user data.
